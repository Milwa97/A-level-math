# About this project


This repository contains post-elementary math course in the form of interactive notebooks. The goal of the course is to deepen understanding of mathematics and develop mathematical intuition based on visual representation of mathematical abstract objects. The level of the course is aligned to the Polish maturity exam at extended level and overlaps with AS/A level.


# How to run?
